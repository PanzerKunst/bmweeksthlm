**European Regional Contacts, Community Leaders and Regional event leads will gather in Stockholm with Burning Man Staff for the fourth annual Burning Man European Leadership Summit.**

Through three days of presentations, group discussions and networking, participants and staff will gain a deeper understanding of the broad range of community initiatives and visions of the future shared by Burners from countries across the continent, while enjoying practical workshops, panels, and talks. It will take place March 3-March 5, 2017. While the ELS is an invite-only event, some of the talks and workshops will be open to the wider community. Weâ€™ll communicate more information about those workshops as our program firms up.
