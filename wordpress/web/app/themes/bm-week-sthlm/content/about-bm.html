**Once a year, over 70,000 people gather in Nevadaâ€™s Black Rock Desert to create Black Rock City, a temporary metropolis dedicated to community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance. In this crucible of creativity, participation is valued as the highest form of currency and takes place in myriad forms---from lavish costuming, to art cars, to performance art and spectacle.**

The event is described as an experiment in community and art, and guided by a common ethos expressed in the [10 Principles](#ten-principles), penned by Founder Larry Harvey First held in 1986 on Baker Beach in San Francisco, California, Burning Man has since been held annually, from the last Sunday in August to the first Monday in September and draws participants from across the globe and culminates in the ritual burning of a large wooden effigy, "the Man" on Saturday evening.

Burning Man has a thriving <a href="http://regionals.burningman.org" target="_blank">Regional Network</a> comprised of over 285 year-round volunteer Regional Contacts in 35 countries and over 65 official regional events around the world. Burning Man brings together community leaders at an Global Leadership Conference in San Francisco and at an annual European Leadership Summit which will take place in Stockholm in March, 2017.
