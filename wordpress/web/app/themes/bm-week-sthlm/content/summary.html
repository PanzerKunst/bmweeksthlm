**For one week, we invite the city of Stockholm to create events and meetings that cross-pollinate the ideas and practices sprung from Burning Man with the society at large. We invite you to create events that brings together the problems and passions of our time in a collective exploration of what could be.**

For one week, dozens of events will take place all over the city, with a wide range of topics, depth and formats. All of them will be created, through the initiative of the community (yes, that's You).

***So, what are You passionate about? Is it education, urban planning or dodgeball? Circus arts, the refugee crisis or techno music? Yoga, mindfulness or startups? The Burning Man Week Stockholm is a space for all of our collective dreaming and hopes for the future.***

All events will be guided by the <a href="http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/" target="_blank">10 Principles of Burning Man</a>, and should be self-reliant, inclusive and participatory. As we invite all to initiate their own events, we wish for each event to reach out in the same manner, and strive to find a diversity of background, diversity of interests and diversity of expression. A co-created week of co-created events. Whether you're experienced or never have created an event before, this is your chance to gift what you are most passionate about.
