            <h4>Can I come?</h4>

            One of the 10 principles of Burning Man is “Radical Inclusion,” that we welcome and respect the stranger. We encourage events to be “radically inclusive.” How this is done is up to the organizers. Some venues might be limited in space, so some events might require preregistration, while other events will be completely open. Check out the event descriptions in the schedule for information about each specific event.

            <h4>What am I required to do if I attend?</h4>

            The core of all things Burning Man is Participation, that we are all doing this together. We want your leadership and initiative, we want your helping hands and emotional support.

            Ask yourself: “What would I like to contribute to this event,” or ask the event organizer “How can I help?”

            No one will judge your contribution, except yourself. In the end, you are always welcome to be a part of any event, no matter how much you contribute.

            <h4>How do I register for the Burning Man Week?</h4>

            Since all events are independently organized, this will depend on the event. Some will be open for drop-in, others will require pre-registration. Check the event descriptions in the schedule for more details on specific events.

            <h4>I’ve heard that there’s also a Burning Man European Leadership Summit. What is that?</h4>

            The Burning Man European Leadership Summit (ELS) will bring together 200 Regional Contacts and community leaders from across Europe. It will take place March 3-March 5, 2017.  While the ELS is an invite-only event, some of the talks and workshops will be open to the wider community. We’ll communicate more information about those workshops  as our program firms up.

            <h4>Who can put on events during the Burning Man Week?</h4>

            Anyone, including you, can take initiative to create an event as a part of the Burning Man Week Stockholm. Both individuals and organizations can host events.

            <h4>What venues are available for hosting my event?</h4>

            There are no central venue available. However, as a community we have access to a range of venues, and if you just ask the question, someone might be able to help you out. Try making a call out in the facebook group or on Slack.

            <h4>Can we bring in sponsors to our event? What is this “Decommodification Principle” all about?</h4>

            We seek to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. This does not necessarily prohibit sponsorship, but it means that any sponsor will not be able to use the event for exposure. Neither can they use documentation of the event for marketing purposes. In-kind donations would be welcome. Any potential sponsor would need to see the other values in supporting our community besides branding, such as having the opportunity to learn and get inspired by new ideas, to network with interesting minds, or to simply support a cause they believe in.

            <h4>Can I charge for my events? Are there any grants available?</h4>

            Hosting an event for Burning Man Week will most likely cost you money, not make you money. We are asking you approach this as an opportunity to give, not to gain.
            Unfortunately, there is no central pot of money to pull from to cover your costs. You are responsible for your own funding. Although we are not specifically prohibiting you from charging admission to your event, we are asking you to think about inclusion and make sure that money doesn’t become a barrier to entry.
            If you must, you may still charge or ask for donations to cover overhead costs. If you do so, you should keep your finances completely transparent to the community.
